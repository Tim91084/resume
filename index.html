            <div style='font-style:italic;'>Vice President /
              Senior Software Developer</div>
          </section>
          <ul>
            <li>Worked on a browser like application container for financial
              advisors to help simplify navigation to the breadth of
              web based applications the bank provides, as well as to the
              different clients and accounts to which a financial advisor has
              access. The application was written using the Vue.js
              JavaScript framework and leverages Electron to provide financial
              advisors with a native desktop application.</li>
            <li>Developed a client dashboard which financial advisors use to
              quickly get relevant information on their clients. Used AngularJS
              to give the application a native feel, and to help with
              perceived performance.</li>
            <li>Developed a client review worksheet which helps financial
              advisors prepare for a detailed annual review with their clients.
              Written in C#, and using the .Net framework, the application is
              able to asynchronously query (using async await) approximately 30
              webservices to aggregate data for the worksheet.
            </li>
            <li>Was instrumental in transitioning the team to git based source
              control using bitbucket, and continuous integration using jenkins</li>
            <li>Developed and maintained a document sharing application which
              facilitates communication between financial advisors and their
              clients.</li>
            <li>Constructed CSS style sheets for web site theming and layout
              which are used across several sites to provide a consistent look
              and feel to the users.</li>
            <li>Used JavaScript and the jQuery library to implement client side
              sorting, paging, and filtering on html tables; to add client side
              interaction using event binding and delegation; and to inject
              dynamic content onto a page using ajax.
            </li>
            <li>Identified application performance bottlenecks and improved
              them by, for example, combining images into a css sprite,
              parallelizing web service calls, and using asynchronous IO.</li>
